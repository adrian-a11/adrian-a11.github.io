#### Brief History
The building first belonged to the Helsinki University of Technology. Helsinki University of Technology and Univeristy of Art and Designed merged and began operating as Aalto University in 2010.

#### Purpose
This building was first established to be a Student Center for students of Helsinki University of Technology. This building was made to encompass many social activites like "meetings, night entertainment, performances, film screenings, dinners, dances". This building was also to be used as a dining area during the winter and an area for formal meetings during the summer. 

#### Uses
After the merger, Dipoli became the main building of Aalto University and recieved a complete renovation that was completed in 2017. Although Dipoli still hosts many University and Students events and activites, it functions more as a meeting and work place for administration, students, and the academic community. Dipoli also contains restaurants, caferterias, and a bar, and continues to display university research and projects.
